# Welcome to our Awesome Car Website!<br>
<br>
## This website was created by Peter Parthimos and Nicolas Spagnolo for our Unix final project, where we were tasked with deploying a web server and creating a group website. This is that website.<br>
### Below is a list of some pretty awesome cars:
<br>
<br>
# 1. Ferrari SF90 Spider
This car is the first hybrid powered car that Ferrari has made. It is all new for 2021 and is Ferrari's new flagship model, and comes in at a cool $650,000

# 2. Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport
Most people can only dream of ever owning a Bugatti, and that holds true for this 1500HP beast. With a price tag of a whopping $3,600,000, Bugatti better like you, because even if you *could* afford it, you need to still be approved by the mark themselves.

# 3. Chevrolet Spark
This incredible piece of technology will make any Bugatti driver shake in their boots at the thought of encountering one of these bad boys. With a price tag of only $10,000, you can buy 360 of these for the price of one of those lame Bugatti's we saw above.

# 4. Chevrolet Corvette
All new for 2020! The new C8 Corvette features a mid-engine layout and more aggressive styling then the outgoing model, and still only comes in at $70,000. Why buy an exotic car when you can get the same performance for half the price?

# 5. Rolls-Royce Phantom
The peak of luxury. This $570,000 land yacht will get you wherever you need to go without breaking a sweat. Equipped with a 6.7L V12 it's no slouch either, and its 563HP will bring you from 0-60MPH in a comfortable 5.2 seconds.
